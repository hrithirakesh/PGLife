PG Life is a Full-Stack Web Application created as part of my Internshala Full Stack Web Development Internship Training. With guidance from the training, I developed this web application based on my understanding and customized it to enhance user experience with improved functionalities.
The web app is hosted at: https://lasya.free.nf/index.php
It is fully responsive and operational on any device.
Tech Stack: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 5, JavaScript, AJAX, PHP, MySQL.

Features:

Homepage: Users can view PGs listed in the database for a given city by entering the name of the city in the search bar. Users can click on the circular areas representing the main cities to examine the PGs located in those cities.

Page of the PG List: presents all of the PGs in the chosen city along with their key characteristics as eye-catching cards. Rent and rating can be sorted by PG in either ascending or decreasing order using a filter bar. The number of users that have tagged each PG as interested is displayed to show how popular it is. By clicking the heart icon, logged-in users can indicate their interest in PGs. This action modifies the look of the icon according to user interaction and dynamically updates the number of interested people.

Page of PG Details: The full information of that PG are displayed when you click "View" on the property list page. A carousel of images with the chosen PG is shown at the top. neatly displays all information, including the address, amenities, and customer reviews. the number of users who have selected the PG as interesting. From the details page, logged-in users can indicate PGs as interested; the number of interested users is updated dynamically by the heart icon.

Dashboard: only available to users that are signed in. displays the user's account data who is logged in. features a section titled "Interesting properties," which shows cards of PGs that the user has indicated as being of interest. By clicking the heart icon, users can remove PGs from their list of people they are interested in, and the area will update dynamically.

Navbar: shows the name of the brand. if the user is not logged in, displays alternatives for signing up and logging in. displays the Dashboard, the Logout choices, and the initial name of the user who is currently logged in using SESSION. Robust toggler navigation bar.

Breadcrumbs: shows the user's present location in the online application. includes hyperlinks for convenient browsing.

Footnote: a list of well-known cities with links to view PGs in those locations. shows facts about copyright.

The web app is easy to use and appealing to new users because it can be accessed without logging in. Nevertheless, logging in is required for some functions, such as the dashboard and marking PGs as interesting.
